# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
#puts 5
#puts "Hello World!"
#puts 7*(2+2)
#puts 7.0/2.0

# Perform simple math with numbers

# Strings
#puts "na jaane kyun...naa jaane kyun"

# Combine strings together

# Variables
food = "tacos"
#puts food

#x = 5 
#y = 7
#d = x*y 
#puts d 

# Combine strings and variables
#puts "Tacos" + " are awesome"
#puts "tacos" + 3

#puts "#{x + y} + tacos"

# String manipulation
